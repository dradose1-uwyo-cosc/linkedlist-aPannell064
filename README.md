## Worked with/sources 
* I used https://gobyexample.com/errors to help me understand how to use errors
  
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* As far as I can tell, everything works fine. It ran on both the VM and the COSC Linux machines.
* Please note, however, that the pop() implementation in the stack returns a boolean value even
  though this is inconsistent with the other methods in the project. This is because it is based
  on the method signature provided in the assignment description, which returns a string and a
  bool value.
